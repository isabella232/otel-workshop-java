## Welcome to the OpenTelemetry Glitch Java Workshop!

In this Glitch workshop, we will instrument a Java application. Note this workshop is meant to come after the Node
workshop. The application and workshop steps can be found in `/src/main/java`. The answer to this workshop can be found in
`src_instrumented`. Have suggestions on how to improve this lab? PRs welcomed!
